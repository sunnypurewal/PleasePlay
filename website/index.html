          <p>
            Sonnio keeps parental accounts untouched. Kids log in once to their favorite streaming service, use the
            iPad they already love, and control everything with friendly voice prompts.

          <p>
            Sonnio listens for warm, conversational commands. “Play The Beatles,” “What song is this?”, or even
            “Let’s hear something upbeat.” Voice-first shortcuts keep momentum without clunky menus.

            <p>
              Kids deserve a frictionless way to explore music. Sonnio was born from watching little ones struggle with
              grown-up apps and tangled parental controls.
